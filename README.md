## COMPILATION  

	our shell will be compiled this way:
	```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh ```

##TESTING

	our shell works like this in interactive mode:
	```
	$ ./hsh
	($) /bin/ls
	hsh main.c shell.c
($)
	($) exit
	$
	```
	But also in non-interactive mode:
	```
	$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
	hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
	$
	$ cat test_ls_2
	/bin/ls
	/bin/ls
	$
	$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
	hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
	hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
	$
	```
